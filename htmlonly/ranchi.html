      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Ranchi is the capital and largest city of Jharkhand, located in eastern
        India on the Ranchi Plateau, part of the larger Chota Nagpur Plateau. It
        lies along the Subarnarekha River and is known for its scenic hills,
        forests, lakes, and numerous waterfalls — earning it the nickname “City
        of Waterfalls.” It was a municipality since 1869 and later became the
        capital of Jharkhand when the state was formed in 2000. Historically,
        Ranchi also served as the summer capital of the old state of Bihar.

      <h2>Geography</h2>
      <p>
        Ranchi sits on a plateau with lofty flat-topped hills (pats) and an
        escarpment which gives rise to many waterfalls like Hundru, Dassam, and
        Jonha. The city has a moderate climate — cooler in winter (Oct-Feb) and
        warm/humid in summer and monsoon.
